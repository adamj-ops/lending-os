# Spring 2A ‚Äì Features Blitz  
*Phase: Differentiation Features for Lending OS*  
*Date: [insert date]*  
*Prepared by: [Product / PM Name]*

## üéØ Purpose  
This blitz is focused on defining and prioritizing **differentiating, tech-/AI-forward features** for Lending OS. These are features that go beyond the core modules, aimed at delivering unique value, competitive advantage, and future-proofing the product.  
We will identify a set of high-impact features, categorize them, estimate effort, and prioritize them for upcoming epics.

## üìã Feature List  
| # | Feature | Description | Tech/AI Bevel | Estimated Effort* | Priority |
|---|---------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|----------|
| 1 | AI-Driven Early Risk & Opportunity Signals | ML-based detection of borrower or property risk/opportunity (e.g., likely default, budget overrun) + alerting dashboard | Medium-High | 8 pts | High |
| 2 | Natural-Language & Command Palette UX | ‚ÄúCmd+K‚Äù or voice commands to search, query portfolio, create records (e.g., ‚ÄúShow loans > $500k past due‚Äù) | Medium | 5 pts | Medium |
| 3 | Nested Real-Time Portfolio Forecasting | Scenario modelling (cash flows, delinquency, yield) with interactive charts | High | 13 pts | High |
| 4 | Document/Image AI Extraction for Draws | Upload photos/receipts and use vision/AI to validate work completion, identify budget line item issues | High | 13 pts | Medium |
| 5 | Investor/Lender Marketplace & Dynamic Participation | Live matching of lenders to loans, real-time participation tracking, statements | Medium | 8 pts | Medium |
| 6 | Plug-&-Play API & Webhook Ecosystem | Public API endpoints + webhooks for integrations (accounting, CRM, BI) | Medium | 8 pts | Medium |
| 7 | Adaptive Workflow Builder (Low-Code) | Visual designer for lenders to define custom loan/draw workflows (states, actions, notifications) | High | 13 pts | Low |
| 8 | Advanced Search & Relationship Navigation | Graph-style views (borrower ‚Üî loan ‚Üî property), smart filters, keyboard shortcuts | Medium | 5 pts | High |
| 9 | Embedded Compliance & Audit Intelligence | Dashboard showing missing docs, expiring insurance, risk scores from edit logs, anomaly detection | Medium-High | 8 pts | High |
| 10| Mobile-First Inspector App (Offline Support) | PWA or native view for on-site inspectors: photo capture, offline mode, geo tagging | Medium | 8 pts | Medium |

\* Effort estimates are relative story points for planning.  
Priority: **High** = must target soon, **Medium** = consider next cycle, **Low** = nice‚Äêto‚Äêhave.

## ‚úÖ Prioritized Must-Haves  
Based on value, uniqueness, and feasibility, we recommend targeting the following in the next 1-2 epics:  
1. AI-Driven Early Risk & Opportunity Signals (Feature #1)  
2. Nested Real-Time Portfolio Forecasting (Feature #3)  
3. Advanced Search & Relationship Navigation (Feature #8)  
4. Embedded Compliance & Audit Intelligence (Feature #9)

These represent a strong competitive differentiation while leaning on data/analytics capabilities we can build on existing stack (Neon + Drizzle + real-time snapshot jobs).

## üìÖ Proposed Phasing  
- **Epic A (Differentiation 1)**: Features #1, #8, #9  
- **Epic B (Differentiation 2)**: Features #3, #2, #6  
- **Epic C (Future-Enhancement)**: Features #4, #5, #7, #10  

## üéØ Success Metrics for This Blitz  
- Feature adoption: ‚â• 30% of power users engage these new features in first 30 days  
- Demonstrable reduction in user friction: e.g., time from loan creation to decision reduced by 20%  
- Differentiation story: At least 2 public case studies using these features as unique selling points  

## üõ† Next Steps  
1. Translate prioritized features into epics ‚Üí break down into stories (with ACs)  
2. Update solution architecture doc with new service components (e.g., RiskEngine, ForecastService, GraphSearchService)  
3. Define data model enhancements required (materialized views, anomaly detection tables)  
4. Lock estimation & planning for next sprint/epic

/**
 * Clerk Configuration
 * 
 * This file provides Clerk configuration helpers.
 * Clerk is initialized via environment variables:
 * - CLERK_SECRET_KEY (server-side)
 * - NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY (client-side)
 * 
 * Clerk is automatically configured via @clerk/nextjs package.
 * No manual initialization needed - use auth() and useAuth() from @clerk/nextjs/server and @clerk/nextjs/react

# Documentation Index

This folder organizes documentation into a predictable structure. Some legacy documents still live in the repository root and will be moved here incrementally.

- architecture/: high‑level diagrams, route matrices, design decisions (ADRs)
- ops/: operations, setup, deployment, testing
- sprints/: sprint summaries, migration notes, implementation logs
- ui/: design tokens, theme presets, UI standards

Planned relocations from the repository root:

- Sprints: MIGRATION-*.md, IMPLEMENTATION-COMPLETE.md, PHASE-3-IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md, NEXT-STEPS.md
- Ops: SETUP.md, TEST-RESULTS-COMPREHENSIVE.md, TESTING-IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md, GIT-COMMIT-GUIDE.md, COMPONENT-INSTALLATION-CHECKLIST.md
- Architecture: ROUTE-ACCESS-MATRIX.md, FUND-SERVICE-FOLLOWON.md
- UI: UI-STANDARDS-QUICKSTART.md, MIDDAY-UI-UPGRADE-SUMMARY.md, Dark Modern Darker-color-theme.json

This index will be updated as files are migrated.

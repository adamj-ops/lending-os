## Business Rules

### Payment Application Order

1. Outstanding fees (late fees, NSF fees)
2. Accrued interest
3. Principal balance

### Late Payment Logic

- Grace period: 10 days after due date
- Late fee: Lesser of 5% of payment or $50
- Late status triggers after grace period expires

### Interest Calculation

- Daily interest = (Principal Ã— Annual Rate) / 365
- Compounding: Simple interest (no compound)
- Accrual: Daily, paid monthly

### 6. API Routes Created

**Loan Documents**
- `GET /api/v1/loans/[id]/documents` - List all documents
- `POST /api/v1/loans/[id]/documents` - Upload new document
- `DELETE /api/v1/loans/[id]/documents/[docId]` - Delete document (also removes from S3)

**Loan Notes**

**Wizard**
- `POST /api/v1/loans/wizard` - Create loan with all relations atomically

### 7. TypeScript Type Definitions

**New Types Created**

- `LoanDocument` and `CreateLoanDocumentDTO` (`src/types/loan-document.ts`)
- `LoanNote`, `CreateLoanNoteDTO`, `UpdateLoanNoteDTO` (`src/types/loan-note.ts`)
- `WizardState` with all step data interfaces (`src/lib/wizard-state.ts`)
- `UploadedFile` interface in FileUpload component

### 8. Bug Fixes & Improvements

**Fixed Pre-existing Issues**
- ‚úÖ Delete method `rowCount` pattern - Updated all services to work with Drizzle ORM
- ‚úÖ Circular dependency - Removed `loanId` from properties schema
- ‚úÖ Next.js 16 async params - Fixed all `[id]` route handlers
- ‚úÖ Progress component prop - Removed invalid `indicatorClassName` from portfolio page
- ‚úÖ DataTable usage - Created `SimpleDataTable` wrapper for easier use

**Schema Cleanup**
- Removed bidirectional loan ‚Üî property relationship
- Simplified to unidirectional: loans ‚Üí properties (via propertyId)
- Updated types and services accordingly

## üì¶ Dependencies Added

```json
{
  "@aws-sdk/client-s3": "^3.x",
  "@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner": "^3.x",
  "zustand": "^4.x"
}
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

### Why Drawer Instead of Dedicated Page?
- **Faster workflow** - View details without losing list context
- **Better UX** - Quick peek at loan info without full navigation
- **Mobile friendly** - Drawer slides in from right on all devices

### Why Zustand for Wizard State?
- **Lightweight** - Minimal boilerplate vs Redux
- **Persistent across steps** - Easy state management across 7 steps
- **Type-safe** - Full TypeScript support
- **Resettable** - Clean state reset on wizard close/complete

### Why Presigned URLs for S3?
- **Security** - No AWS credentials exposed to client
- **Performance** - Direct client-to-S3 upload (no server proxy)
- **Scalability** - Offload bandwidth to S3
- **Progress tracking** - XHR upload with progress events

### Atomic Wizard Transactions
- Creates all entities (borrower, property, lender, loan, documents) in single API call
- Reduces race conditions and partial failures
- Simpler error handling and rollback

## üîß Environment Configuration

**Required .env.local Variables**

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key

```

**S3 Bucket Setup Requirements**

## üêõ Known Issues / Limitations

### Minor
- User attribution currently hardcoded as "Current User" - needs session integration
- Organization ID hardcoded in wizard - needs session-based org resolution
- No inline editing in drawer tabs yet (Sprint 3)
- Payment history placeholder (Sprint 3 feature)

### Future Enhancements
- Bulk document upload
- Document version history
- Note mentions/tagging
- Rich text editor for notes
- Document preview modal
- Progress tab with actual payment data

---

## üîê Security Considerations

**S3 Upload Security**
- Presigned URLs expire after 1 hour
- File uploads scoped to specific folders
- Server validates file metadata before DB storage
- Delete operations check loan ownership (when auth implemented)

**API Security**
- All routes use `requireAuth()` middleware
- Input validation on all endpoints
- SQL injection protection via Drizzle ORM
- Error messages don't expose internal details

---

## üìà Next Steps

### Immediate (Pre-Testing)
1. Add AWS credentials to `.env.local`
2. Create and configure S3 bucket
3. Update session.ts to return current user ID
4. Test wizard flow end-to-end
5. Test drawer with real loan data

### Sprint 3 Planning
1. Payments table and API
2. Draw requests and inspector workflow
3. Payment history integration in Progress tab
4. User attribution from session
5. Organization scoping

---

## üí° Key Learnings

### Next.js 16 Changes
- Params are now async in route handlers: `{ params: Promise<{ id: string }> }`
- Must await params before accessing: `const { id } = await params;`
- Applied pattern across all [id] routes

### Drizzle ORM Patterns
- Delete operations don't return rowCount in newer versions
- Avoid circular schema dependencies (properties ‚Üî loans)
- Use unidirectional foreign keys

### State Management
- Zustand excellent for wizard-style multi-step flows
- Simple API, minimal boilerplate
- Type-safe with proper TypeScript definitions

---

## üìù Code Quality Notes

- Consistent error handling patterns
- Comprehensive TypeScript types

**Performance**
- Direct S3 uploads avoid server bandwidth
- Presigned URLs cached for performance
- Lazy loading of tab content
- Efficient query patterns with Drizzle

**User Experience**
- Loading states in all async operations
- Error messages with toast notifications
- Responsive design for all components
- Keyboard navigation support
- Empty states with clear CTAs

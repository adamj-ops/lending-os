## 💡 Technical Insights

### Payment Schedule Mathematics
Successfully implemented amortization calculator:
```
Monthly Payment = (P × r × (1 + r)^n) / ((1 + r)^n - 1)
```
Where:
- P = Principal
- r = Monthly interest rate
- n = Number of payments

Generates accurate payment schedules with principal/interest breakdown.

### Workflow State Machines
Clean state transitions for draw workflow:
```
Requested → Approved → Inspected → Disbursed
            ↓
          Rejected
```

### Budget Tracking Algorithm
Real-time budget utilization:
- Track by budget line items
- Calculate percentage used
- Show variance (budget vs actual)
- Remaining budget calculation

## ⚠️ Before Testing - Apply Migration

**IMPORTANT**: The database migration must be applied first!

### Option 1: Apply Migration (Recommended)
```bash
# Ensure DATABASE_URL is set in .env.local
npm run db:migrate
```

### Option 2: Review Migration First
```bash
# Review the SQL
cat src/db/migrations/0004_loan_builder_v2.sql

# Then apply manually via your database tool
```

## 🐛 Known Issues to Watch For

1. **Type Errors**: Some `as any` used in FormField names (TypeScript limitation)
2. **Documents Step**: May need RHF integration (currently uses old pattern)
3. **Property Photos**: S3 upload not yet integrated in property form
4. **Migration**: Generated manually, needs testing

## 🔍 Debugging Tips

### Check Browser Console
Look for:
- React Hook Form validation errors
- API response errors
- Console warnings

### Check Network Tab
Verify:
- POST to `/api/v1/loans/v2` succeeds
- Response structure matches expectations
- Error responses are handled

### Check LocalStorage
Key: `loan-wizard-draft`
- Should contain serialized form data
- Updates on "Save Draft"
- Clears on successful submit

### Common Issues

**Wizard doesn't open**:
- Check if `LoanWizard` component is imported correctly
- Verify `open` prop is controlled properly

**Validation errors don't show**:
- Check Zod schema matches form field names
- Verify `FormMessage` components are present
- Check `mode: "onChange"` in useForm

**Draft doesn't persist**:
- Check localStorage in DevTools
- Verify Zustand persist middleware is configured
- Check `saveDraft` is called on step navigation

**API errors**:
- Verify DATABASE_URL in .env.local
- Check migration was applied
- Review API route console logs

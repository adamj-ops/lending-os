## 🔍 Technical Highlights

### Date Handling
Proper handling of Drizzle date fields (returns strings):
- All date fields use `YYYY-MM-DD` format
- Conversion to `Date` objects only when needed
- Type system correctly reflects date field types

### JSONB Storage
Efficient storage for complex data:
- Payment schedule details
- Draw schedule details
- Inspection photos and signatures
- Proper JSON serialization/deserialization

### Performance Optimization
Strategic indexing for common queries:
- Loan-based queries (primary use case)
- Status filtering (workflow management)
- Date-based queries (reporting)
- Payment method filtering (reconciliation)

### Workflow State Management
Proper status transitions:
- Draw workflow with user attribution
- Inspection lifecycle tracking
- Payment processing states

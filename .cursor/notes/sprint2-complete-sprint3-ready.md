## ðŸŽ‰ Sprint 2 Finalization - COMPLETE

### âœ… Phase 1: Hybrid Relationship Model Validation

**Migration 0005 Applied Successfully**
- Added `role`, `is_primary`, and `percentage` fields to junction tables
- Created performance indexes for fast queries
- Added unique constraints to ensure data integrity
- Migration completed without errors

**API Endpoints Tested & Fixed**
- Fixed Next.js 16 async params pattern in all new endpoints
- `/api/v1/loans/:loanId/borrowers` - Add/get co-borrowers
- `/api/v1/loans/:loanId/lenders` - Add/get participant lenders  
- `/api/v1/loans/:loanId/parties` - Get complete party list
- All endpoints properly handle role tracking and syndication

**Service Layer Verified**
- `LoanService.addCoBorrower()` - Add co-borrowers/guarantors
- `LoanService.addParticipantLender()` - Add syndicated lenders
- `LoanService.getLoanBorrowers()` - Get all borrowers with roles
- `LoanService.getLoanLenders()` - Get all lenders with percentages
- Junction table population during loan creation verified

### âœ… Phase 2: Loan Builder v2 Verification

**Build Status: âœ… SUCCESSFUL**
- TypeScript compilation passes with zero errors
- All 3 loan categories supported (asset_backed, yield_note, hybrid)
- v2 API endpoint `/api/v1/loans/v2` working correctly
- Hybrid model integration verified
- Next.js 16 compatibility confirmed

**Key Features Verified**
- Multi-category loan creation
- Draft persistence with localStorage
- React Hook Form + Zod validation
- AI forecast infrastructure
- Fee management in basis points (BPS)
- Conditional step rendering

## ðŸ“‹ Sprint 3 Specification - COMPLETE

### Comprehensive Technical Specification Created

**Document**: `.cursor/notes/sprint3-payments-draws-spec.md` (500+ lines)

**Key Components Specified:**

#### 1. Database Schema Design
- **Payments Table**: Payment tracking with methods, status, transaction references
- **Draws Table**: Construction draw requests with approval workflows
- **Inspections Table**: Inspection tracking with photo documentation
- **Payment Schedules Table**: Generated payment schedules
- **Draw Schedules Table**: Construction draw schedules

#### 2. Service Layer Architecture
- **PaymentService**: CRUD, processing, balance calculations, schedule generation
- **DrawService**: CRUD, approval workflows, budget tracking
- **InspectionService**: CRUD, photo management, mobile/PWA operations
- **LoanBalanceService**: Real-time calculations, reporting, projections

#### 3. API Endpoint Design
- **Payment Endpoints**: Create, list, update payments with filtering
- **Draw Endpoints**: Create, approve, track draws with workflow
- **Inspection Endpoints**: Schedule, complete inspections with photos
- Complete request/response schemas with examples

#### 4. UI Components Planning
- **Payment UI**: History table, entry form, schedule view, balance cards
- **Draw UI**: Request wizard, timeline tracker, budget charts, approval dashboard
- **Mobile Inspector PWA**: Offline forms, photo capture, sync functionality

#### 5. Mobile Inspector App (PWA)
- Offline-first design with service workers
- Photo documentation with GPS tagging
- Digital forms with auto-save
- Background sync with conflict resolution

#### 6. Implementation Phases
- **Phase 1**: Core Database & Services (Week 1)
- **Phase 2**: Payment Management (Week 2)
- **Phase 3**: Draw Management (Week 3)
- **Phase 4**: Mobile Inspector App (Week 4)
- **Phase 5**: Integration & Testing (Week 5)

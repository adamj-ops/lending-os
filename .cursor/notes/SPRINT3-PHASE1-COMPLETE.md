## 💡 Technical Highlights

### Payment Schedule Generation
Implemented amortization calculator with support for:
- **Amortized payments**: Principal + Interest with declining balance
- **Interest-only payments**: Interest payments with balloon at end
- Formula: `P = (L * r * (1 + r)^n) / ((1 + r)^n - 1)`
- Generates complete payment schedule with remaining balances

### Draw Workflow Management
Complete state machine implementation:
- **Requested**: Initial draw request submitted
- **Approved**: Lender approves with amount
- **Inspected**: Work inspected and verified
- **Disbursed**: Funds released to borrower
- **Rejected**: Draw request rejected

### Budget Tracking
Intelligent budget allocation:
- Tracks budget by line items
- Calculates percentage used
- Shows remaining budget
- Variance analysis (budget vs actual)

### Type Safety
Complete type coverage:
- Enums for all status fields
- DTO types for API requests
- Response types for API responses
- Service method return types
- Proper date handling (string vs Date)
